<h2> &#128269; About the project </h2><br>

<p>A simple greenhouse monitoring system made in ESP32. The system detects possible risks for plants, such as: temperature, humidity and light. The 
user will be warned whenever one of the conditions is inappropriate.</p><br>

<ul>
  <li>The system has 2 sensors: DHT22 for monitoring temperature and humidity and the Photoresistor (LDR) sensor for measuring luminosity;</li>
  <li>If the temperature drops below 10ยบ or above 20ยบ, the system will will be in temperature alarm condition;</li>
  <li>If the humidity is greater than 60%, the system will be in humidity alarm condition;</li>
  <li>If the brightness drops below 500, the system will be in brightness alarm condition;</li>
  <li>The buzzer will sound whenever the system enters an alarm situation;</li>
  <li>If the system enters any alarm situation, the blue button next to the buzzer can be activated so the buzzer stops sounding;</li>
  <li>The button can also be pressed at any time to disable the alarm system if the user does not wish to be notified.</li>
</ul>
